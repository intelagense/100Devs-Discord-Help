## Asking questions in the Discord

### How do I ask my question?
#### The Process:
1. Pick a relevant help channel.
1. Type your question and press enter.
1. The needle bot will open a new thread for you **'automagically.'**
1. Paste any related code, code snippets, and/or images **inside** this new thread.
1. Wait patiently... 

Eventually someone should come around. They may ask you for additional info and then try to help you work through the problem.

**After** your question has been answered give a quick thanks and press the green **'archive thread'** button at the top of the thread.

### Searching for previous answers.
Press `Ctrl+F` and start typing to search. (On mobile devices tap the üîé magnifying glass icon on the top right of the screen) 

There are several filters you can use to narrow your search. Try typing `in:` and the name of a channel to display only the search results from that channel or `from:` and a username to display all of the messages from a particular user. 

üí° There are many more powerful tools you can use in search. For more in-depth information check out the [Discord guide to using search (external link)](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000468588-Using-Search)

### Best time to ask questions
Any time you find yourself stuck on something for more than 20 minutes is the best time to hop on Discord and ask questions. However the amount of active members in the help channels varies greatly throughout the day and also week to week. 

### What are code blocks?
One of Discord's features is that it uses 'Markdown' syntax to display text. You can surround the code you type in chat with backticks and it will be displayed in a way that is easier for other developers to read.

Using three backticks in a row will create a multi-line code block. Type the name of the language you are using directly after the first triple-backtick to use syntax highlighting.

````
```[type the language here]
[paste your code here]
```
````

> üí° Use single backticks to display `` `inline code` `` (Inline only, no color coding.)

### More ways to get help

#### Study groups
If you are a member of a local or affinty study group you can start your own thread in the group and try asking your question there.

#### Use Search
> See [Searching for previous answers](#searching-for-previous-answers)

#### Voice chat
Sometimes the fastest way to get your question answered is to join a voice chat and ask for help directly. You can also go into an empty voice chat and start sharing your screen and folx will show up out of curiosity. 

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I join catch-up crew?

### What is a thread? and how does it work?
TLDR - A thread is basically a mini channel inside a main channel used to focus on a single topic. Messages sent inside the help channels are automatically transformed into a thread by the 'Needle Bot.'

> üí° For more in-depth information on how Discord threads work check out the official [Discord threads FAQ (External link)](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403205878423-Threads-FAQ)

### Code blocks for 'pros'

Users not familiar with Markdown may be unaware that they can display their code using code blocks in Discord. 

#### Showing users how to create codeblocks

An easy way to show users how to create a code block is to type a short example code block and then escape the triple backticks with a backslash. This will display as a plaintext message in Discord without hiding the backticks:

<img align="left" src="images/escapedbackticks.png" alt="Multiline triple backtick code block with colored syntax highlighting.">

üí° Try pasting this code into a Discord message:
```
\```javascript
Your code goes here.
\```
```

#### Discord vs Pandoc code blocks
In standard Pandoc Markdown you can show an example of how code blocks are created by nesting a regular triple-backticked code block within a quadruple-backbacked code block but this does not work in Discord.

<!--- Note: If you are viewing this file in raw mode please realize that I had to use yet another additional layer of codeblocks to create this README--->

`````
````
```[language]
[code]
```
````
`````

Markdown in Discord requires that you insert a Zero Width Space (U+200B) within any triple-backticks you wish to escape when displaying backticks inside a code block.
````
```             //normal triple-backtick
`‚Äã``[language]   //escaped triple-backtick (No visible difference due to the Zero Width Space.)
[code] 
`‚Äã``
```
````

#### Syntax highlighting hack

When specifying the [language] in a normal code block Discord will apply syntax highlighting. This highlighting is lost when using nested code blocks. You can manually apply syntax highlighting in your code block using ANSI syntax in your markdown. 

<p>This code...</p>

````
```ansi
`‚Äã``[34mjavascript[0m
[32mconst[0m markdown = tricky;
[32mif[0m([36m'difficult'[0m){
  [31mconsole[0m.log([36m'copy + paste'[0m)
}
`‚Äã``
```
````

<p>which looks like this when editing in Discord...</p>

<p>will display like this to other users.</p>
<img src="images/discordansirender.png" alt="Screenshot of rendered message text in Discord that uses ansi codes to manually apply syntax highlighting">
<p>Using ansi color in examples will help the viewer to understand why the [language] is included after the triple-backticks.</p>
