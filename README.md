# 100Devs-Discord-Maintenance-Adjunct
Unsanctioned supplemental files and information for the 100Devs Discord.

## What is the purpose

Primarily created to collaborate on and edit markdown for code snippets in pinned messages.

Normally in markdown you can demonstrate how to create code blocks by nesting a triple-backticked code block within a quadruple-backbacked code block like this:

<!--- Note: If you are viewing this file in raw mode please realize that I am using an additional layer of codeblocks in order for GitHub to create this README--->
`````
````
```[language]
[code]
```
````
`````

In Discord you must use insert a Zero Width Space (U+200B) within the triple-backtick you wish to escape
````
```             //normal triple-backtick
`​``javascript  //escaped triple-backtick
let type = 
`​``
```
````

And in order to better illustrated that colored syntax highlighting is possible you must go even one step further using ANSI syntax in your markdown.
