## Asking questions in the Discord

### How do I ask my question?

### Searching for previous answers.

### Best time to ask?

### What about voice chat?
Sometimes the fastest way to get your question answered is to join a voice chat and ask for help directly. You can also go into an empty voice chat and start sharing your screen and folx will start showing up out of curiosity. 

### What are code blocks?
One of Discord's features is that it uses 'Markdown' syntax to display text. You can surround the code you type in a chat with backticks and it will be displayed in a way that is easier for you and the other developers to read. 

Using three backticks in a row will create a multi-line code block. Type the name of the language you are using directly after the first triple-backtick to use syntax highlighting.

```[type your language here]
[paste your code here]
```
````

💡 Use single backticks to make an `` `inline code block` `` (One line only, no color coding)



## Answering questions

### How can I help?
>“If you have come here to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together.”

### Code blocks for 'pros'

Users not familiar with Markdown may be unaware that they can display their code using code blocks in Discord. 

In standard Pandoc Markdown you can show an example of how code blocks are created by nesting a regular triple-backticked code block within a quadruple-backbacked code block but this does not work in Discord.

<!--- Note: If you are viewing this file in raw mode please realize that I had to use yet another additional layer of codeblocks to create this README--->

`````
````
```[language]
[code]
```
````
`````

Markdown in Discord requires that you insert a Zero Width Space (U+200B) within any triple-backticks you wish to escape.
````
```             //normal triple-backtick
`​``[language]   //escaped triple-backtick (No visible difference due to the Zero Width Space.)
[code] 
`​``
```
````

#### Syntax highlighting hack

When specifying the [language] in a normal code block Discord will apply syntax highlighting. This highlighting is lost when using nested code blocks. You can manually apply syntax highlighting in your code block using ANSI syntax in your markdown. 

<p>This code...</p>

````
```ansi
`​``[34mjavascript[0m
[32mconst[0m markdown = tricky;
[32mif[0m([36m'difficult'[0m){
  [31mconsole[0m.log([36m'copy + paste'[0m)
}
`​``
```
````

<p>which looks like this when editing in Discord...</p>

<p>will display as this to other users.</p>

<p>Using ansi color in examples will help the viewer to understand why the [language] is included after the triple-backticks.</p>
