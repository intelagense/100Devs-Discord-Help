# 100Devs-Discord-Markdown
Unsanctioned supplemental files and information for the 100Devs Discord.

## What is the purpose

Primarily created to collaborate on markdown examples for code snippets in pinned messages.

In Pandoc Markdown you can demonstrate how to create code blocks by nesting a triple-backticked code block within a quadruple-backbacked code block

  [code]

In Discord Markdown you must use insert a Zero Width Space (U+200B) within the triple-backticks you wish to escape
````
```             //normal triple-backtick
`â€‹``[language]  //escaped triple-backtick
  [code] 
`â€‹``
```
````

In order to display syntax highlighting you must go even one step further using ANSI syntax in your markdown.
